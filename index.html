                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is the first time I've tried to make a multi-page website. I started learning 
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in August 2023, and I've learned quite a bit so far. 
                    I still have lots more to learn, especially with JavaScript, but what I've learned
                    so far has given me a great structure for the knowledge I'll gain in the future.
                </p>
                <p>I've created navigation links to two other pages: one has some work I'm proud of 
                    from my Front-End Development class, and the other has some artwork I'm proud of.
                </p>
